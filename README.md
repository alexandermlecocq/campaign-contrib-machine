# Campaign Contribution Machine

The past few federal election cycles have demonstrated the significance of attracting a broad base of individual donors. This project is an interactive mapping system designed to help political campaigns tailor their efforts by location. It combines the 3.5 million individual donations recorded by the FEC (for each 2 year federal election cycle) with 163 demographic markers recorded by the US Census in order to build a deep learning model that can predict how much a given zip code is likely to donate and to which party. If this number is substantially lower than the actual donations from that location, this may indicate an untapped pool of potential donors and thus help campaigns to direct their outreach more effectively. 


## Getting Started

A live version of this project, running on data for Illinois specifically, can be found [here](https://campaign-contributions.herokuapp.com "Finance your Campaign").




## Built With

* Python and Pandas to create an ETL pipeline that combined individual contribution data from the Federal Election Commission with demographics pulled from the US Census API
* Tensorflow was then used to build a deep learning model to predict a given zipcodeâ€™s likely quartile for individual donations
* These tables were then loaded into a SQLite relational database
* The final webpage was built around a Flask app, using SQLAlchemy to interface with the database, Javascript and Leaflet to provide interactive maps, and Bootstrap and HTML to create the page templates
* The site is currently hosted on Heroku
